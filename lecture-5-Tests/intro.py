# Unit Testing in Python

# Testing
# - best practice is to perform unit tests to make sure our code is running as intended
# - need to figure edge cases that may be present, preventing our code of running

# Unit Testing
# - unit testing is the testing of single units of our program
# - typically tests for functions we've written
# - best practice to make very simple tests

from calculator import square
