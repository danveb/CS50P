# Conditionals in Python

# Conditionals allow the program to make decisions
# > and < symbols are probably quite familiar to you.
# >= denotes “greater than or equal to.”
# <= denotes “less than or equal to.”
# == denotes “equals, though do notice the double equal sign! A single equal sign would assign a value. Double equal signs are used to compare variables.
# != denotes “not equal to.

# If statements

# Control flow: elif and else statements

# Or
# - or allows to decide between one or more alternatives

# And
# - and allows to be used in conditional statements

# Modulo
# - parity refers to whether a number is even or odd
# - we can use "modulo" operator to see if two numbers divide evenly or divide and have a remainder
# - 4 % 2 = 0
# - 3 % 2 = 1

# Pythonic
# - In programming there are certain pieces of code that are only "Pythonic"
# - this means we only seen in Python, nowhere else

# Match
# - match statements can be used to conditionally run code that matches certain values
# - just like "SWITCH" statements in JavaScript...
